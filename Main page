var testimonials = ["\"We purchased a vehicle from Midwest Car Search in April 2012 and were very satisfied with the negotiations and post-sale follow up to transfer the title and secure license plates. Midwest Car Search also services our three vehicles. Their honest assessments of current and future issues and favorable labor rates keep our operating costs low while enabling us to avoid expensive repairs caused by excessive deferred maintenance and vehicle retention. Anyone with reasonable expectations will appreciate their sales and service experiences with Midwest Car Search. I recommend them to all of our friends.\"", "\"I bought my car maybe a year ago at Midwest and have been going back ever since.  I researched my options, found Midwest online with one of the lowest prices on the car I was after and had a hassle-free buying experience.  I have since had my car in for maintenance multiple times and have always been impressed with the quality of service at such an affordable price.  I would say you owe it to yourself to go see them in person!\"", "\"My wife found a fantastic VW Bug with very low miles at an incredible price. A couple days after purchasing the vehicle, one of the front headlights went out. Since Scott promised to fix a minor problem with the car before we purchased it ---which was initially offered without our request -- we were still in contact, and let him know of the problem. Not only did Scott OFFER to replace the bulb, but he did so twice, due to a loose connection. I asked him what I owed, and he said \"don't worry about it\".  This is a fantastic small dealership that offers very personalized, quality service -- you won't find a big dealership that creates and maintains such a great relationship AFTER a sale.\"", "\"I bought a PT Cruiser from Scott at Midwest Car Search back in 2008. I had recently got into an accident that totaled my last vehicle but he helped me find a car that really fit my needs. Whenever I had an issue with the car, or I wanted a second opinion on some maintenance they were always there to help me. I had only expected to keep the car until I graduated college, but it worked so well for me that I kept it for another couple years. Eventually I needed a new car and Scott helped me find a great used Rav 4. I love my new car! I really trust his opinion and he helped me find a vehicle with a great record, new tires, and at a good price. He made it really easy and I would have felt super lost without his help. I felt confident in my purchase and when you’re handing over so much money it’s really a necessity!\"", "\"My experience was excellent... multiple times. I have referred many friends and family there and they all feel treated very well. I've even been able to call Scott for some \"car advice\" and he\'s been very helpful. Go see these people!\"", "\"This is my 2nd vehicle from Midwest Car Search. They work the hardest to get you approved !!!! I would never go anywhere else to get a vehicle. The low payments, warranty, down payments are great...\"", "\"I saw a posting on Craig's List. Found it on the lot exactly the way it was advertised. Spoke with a salesperson and then the owner. Both were very up front with me and open about the car and the finances. I will be referring anyone that islooking for a car to Midwest.\"", "\"I just purchased my first car here at Midwest Car Search. Being a college sophomore I knew I needed to find something that was reliable and well priced. Searching through many different dealers with all the pressure, it was a great relief to finally come to a place such like this. They helped me and my parents find the car that was right for me. They put no pressure on you when you are looking and offers up honest advice to make sure you go home with a car that is right for you. I definitely would recommend looking here for a car!\"", "\"I just purchased my 3rd vehicle from Midwest Car Search after searching at other dealerships for over a month and getting the run around I went back to Midwest and found the exact vehicle I was looking for and at a decent price. Scott the owner is really easy to work with and there is no sales pressure or BS he actually showed me what he had invested in the car. If you ever need to get a vehicle this is the place to go Financing is not a hassle and I recommend the extended warranty it comes with free oil changes every 3 months or 5,000 miles and they inspect your car for problems and they fix them usually the same day. If you need a new car check these guys out Scott Vic and Brandon will treat you right.\"", "\"Shopping for a vehicle can be stressful, frustrating, and quite draining. Many salesmen have only dollar signs in mind before they even let you sit in a car to test drive.This is not the case if you go to Midwest Car Search. From the second you walk in, you will notice the friendly, positive energy that flows from the owner, Scott, and all of his employees. The waiting area is not only exceptionally clean, but there is an entire board filled with thank you cards from grateful customers. You will be treated with the utmost respect.They will talk with you, listen to what your needs are, and be honest with you up front. No sales pitches. People helping people, no matter what the situation is that one may be facing. Scott and Ken worked with me, and I drove out of there as a proud owner of an awesome SUV, the vehicle of my dreams. My daughter has also recently purchased a car here, and was amazed at how easy the entire process was compared to other dealerships we visited. I would recommend to anyone looking for a decent vehicle to visit Scott. He is a man with integrity, who seems to truly live by the \"pay it forward\" principle. It shows on his countenance, by the way he treats his employees, and his customers. I for one, am a very happy customer and would never even consider going anywhere else. Thank you Jesh - who happens to be one of the best mechanics in the business - for recommending this amazing place to my daughter and I. From the moment we walked in, it felt like we made new friends.\"", "\"After months of searching for a quality used vehicle within my budget with no success, I came upon a Midwest Car Search ad on Craigslist that had exactly what I wanted and what I was looking for. Upon going in to take a look at it I was met ...After months of searching for a quality used vehicle within my budget with no success, I came upon a Midwest Car Search ad on Craigslist that had exactly what I wanted and what I was looking for. Upon going in to take a look at it I was met by Ken Seebeck, whose professionalism, honesty and courtesy made my experience enjoyable and stress free, and we were able to come to an agreement and drove my new (to me) car away the next day. If your in the market for a used vehicle at a fair price, check this place out.\"", "\"Probably the most honest car dealer I have ran across in all my car buying experiences. From sales to their service department. Very friendly!  I would recommend them to anyone!\"", "\"When I showed up at Midwest Car Search last Wednesday, I had no intention of purchasing a vehicle that day. What's more, when I looked around their lot, I didn't think I'd be able to afford cars as nice as they had. However after meeting ...When I showed up at Midwest Car Search last Wednesday, I had no intention of purchasing a vehicle that day. What's more, when I looked around their lot, I didn't think I'd be able to afford cars as nice as they had. However after meeting with the owner (who I think was named Scott? Sorry, I'm terrible with names) I was feeling pretty confident that I'd be able to find something, he showed me that they always made sure that they had the best prices around (which matched up with the research I had done before). And helped me find the best vehicle for me, both by walking me through vehicle details, and then by just letting me make my decision on my own. I never felt overly pressured. After looking at the vehicles, I not only found one that worked for me, but Scott and Ken Seebeck helped me get set up with financing that I can easily afford, and Ken walked me through all of the paperwork, making sure that I understood every document before signing. My wife has bought 2 cars here previously, and I'll definitely be coming here first every time I need a car in the future.\"", "\"Great service, people are very friendly, well explained process when acquiring the car, I love the car with low miles excellent price and best of all the person I spoke to was excellent, any concerns or questions were explained to me in an easy way. If I get another car I would definitely go back there! or I will refer a friend.\"", "\"I had a great experience here. The entire staff were patient while answering my many questions and the financing was quick and painless. Once I finally made my decision I was driving my new (to me) car home within hours. I would recommend them to anyone looking for good value and a fair staff that is great to work with.\"" ]
